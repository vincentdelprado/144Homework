      "---------------\n",
      "\n",
      "In pigLatinParts, you will naturally find yourself wanting to connect some tokens into a string again. Remember that we got tokens as a **list**, a sequence of strings, like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "    li = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose I want to print out \"a b c\"; well in that case you can use what we did on Wednesday:\n",
      "\n",
      "    print li[0], li[1], li[2]\n",
      "    # you might want to compare that with print li, just to see what happens\n",
      "\n",
      "But if I want to get a new variable that is \"a b c\", I can't print. What do I do?\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing you can do is do it manually\n",
      "\n",
      "    stringFromLi = li[0] + \" \" + li[1] + \" \" + li[2]\n",
      "\n",
      "But what if I want something more general? In that case, you can use the nifty function `join`, which is designed to link elements of a list together, where the link is given by a string **delimiter**. Remember that I said the stuff between tokens was called a delimiter; well, the same reasoning applies here, since we are detokenizing, or as it's often called **stringifying**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now this is where Python's object-first view makes things rather confusing. In Perl, for instance, if I wanted to join a list with a delimiter, I'd write something basically like:\n",
      "\n",
      "    print join(delimiter, list)\n",

      "    \n",
      "But it doesn't. `join` isn't a basic function like `len`. Rather, it's a [method of ALL strings](http://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#str.join). ???? Well, the idea is that any string could be a delimiter for a list, so what we wanted to do in (1) is actually done this way:\n",
